👋 Hi, I’m @NinaNok, or Nina Nokelainen leagally.

I’m a engineering sutdent about to graduate from KTH in Stockholm this June! I've read the combined bachelor's and master's program called Media technoology, 
it's a computer sciense education with a special focus on human computer interaction. I've also taken the sonic media track during the latter half of the education. 
Here is a link to a description if you want to know more about that https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/interactivemediatechnology/description-1.593765
